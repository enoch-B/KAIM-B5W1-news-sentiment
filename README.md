# Sentiment Analysis Project - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Notebook

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a news articles dataset to understand textual and temporal patterns relevant to sentiment analysis.

The EDA covers:

- Descriptive statistics on headline length  
- Analysis of article counts by publisher  
- Trends in publication dates over time  
- Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on headlines  
- Analysis of publication frequency by hour of day  
- Publisher domain extraction and frequency analysis

The goal is to extract insights that will inform subsequent sentiment modeling and feature engineering.

## Dataset

The notebook expects a CSV file named `articles.csv` (or your own file path) with at least the following columns:

| Column Name        | Description                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| `headline`         | Text of the news headline/article  |
| `publisher`        | Publisher name or email address     |
| `publication_date` | Date and time when article published|

The `publication_date` column must be parseable as a datetime.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your_repo_url>
   cd <your_repo_folder>
````

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download NLTK data**

   The notebook includes commands to download NLTK stopwords and tokenizer models, but you can pre-download manually:

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

5. **Place your dataset**

   Ensure your dataset CSV is placed in `data/articles.csv` or update the path in the notebook.

6. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/task_1_eda.ipynb
   ```
